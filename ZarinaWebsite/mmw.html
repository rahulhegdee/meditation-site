                    <p class="big-text">Zarina offers mindfulness workshops to organizations of all types, tailored to the needs of the group. The workshops run anywhere from 1.5 hours to a full day or two. Participants gain an understanding of the theory and practice of mindfulness and meditation, learn how to meditate both formally and informally, and practice proven stress reduction techniques. Mindfulness can support individuals in greater focus, concentration, and balance as they meet their goals at work and in life.  </p>

                            <p class="small-text">"Zarina led a mindfulness workshop at our annual conference, and it was a wonderful experience! In addition to her expertise in mindfulness practice, Zarina brings a deep commitment to social justice and a collaborative, thoughtful presence to her work. She designed a session for participants of varying experience levels that was welcoming and engaging, and a much-needed opportunity to get centered in the midst of a busy conference program. I highly recommend her work!" - Laurel Potter Huerta, WDN
